    <p>There has been an increase in the number of hearing impaired and
      speech disabled victims due to birth defects, oral diseases and accidents. Sign language is a
      communication method used by deaf and dumb people which makes use of gestures instead of sound.
      They face difficulties in communication as it is not understood by everyone.
      Communication is of paramount importance in todayâ€™s data driven society. To minimize the communication barrier which the deaf and dumb people face in the society,
      we propose a portable device that can translate hand gestures into speech, providing them an aid to communicate easily.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The portable glove is mounted with 5 flex sensors (each on the 5 fingers).</li>
        <li>Combination of digital and analog signals are processed to obtain the output.</li>
        <li>The output from the flex sensors is given to the ADC channels of the microcontroller.</li>
        <li>The processed ADC and digital values from the microcontroller are compared with the threshold values for the recognition of a particular gesture.</li>
        <li>All the data from microcontroller is sent to wav player and audio played by speaker.</li>
      </ul>
