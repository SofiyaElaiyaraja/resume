  <h2>Smart AI Camera</h2>
  <p><strong>Qrio Technologies Private Limited</strong></p>
  <p>Recent technological advances are enabling a new generation of smart cameras that represent a
    quantum leap in sophistication. This device could support a wide variety of applications
    including human and animal detection, surveillance, motion analysis, and facial identification.
    Video processing has an insatiable demand for real-time performance. Smart cameras capture
    high-level descriptions of the scene and analyze what they see. It uses wireless technology to
    provide essential security. The proposed security system captures information and transmits it
    via a Wi-Fi to a static IP, which is viewed using a web browser from any smart device. It streams
    live video and records in the cloud and/or in the windows shared folder for future playback.</p>
